# WIP: Stream Event Schedule Viewer

This is very much a work-in-progress. It currently doesnâ€™t twitch at all!

This extension lets users see upcoming stream event dates/times, as well as descriptions.

## Development

For convenience, use Netlify Dev.

```
# install the Netlify CLI
yarn global add netlify-cli

# clone this repo
git clone git@github.com:jlengstorf/twitch-extension-stream-schedule-viewer.git

# move into the directory
cd twitch-extension-stream-schedule-viewer/

# install dependencies
yarn

# run Netlify Dev
netlify dev
```

The site + serverless functions will be running at `http://localhost:8888`.
